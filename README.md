- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rbagin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a 18 year old student, that is trying to learn how to program on his own. I moved from Slovakia to the Netherlands in the summer 2019, 
 I started going to the Geert Grote College Amsterdam, I struggled for the first half year, because I didnÂ´t know how to speak Dutch, 
 but I managed to learn it and now Iâ€™m fluent in Dutch, English and Slovak. Iâ€™m a fast learner and if I have a passion for something Iâ€™ll put a lot of effort into it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and Iâ€™m going to start learning basics of Python afterwards.
- I want to become a software developer, I enjoy coding, it is very relaxing and enjoyable for me
- I love playing volleyball, going to the gym, exploring nature and learning new stuff
- You can reach me via email- ravi.bagin@gmail.com or discord-Rav155#2882
